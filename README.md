This is the OFFICIAL LightHouse Discord bot Repository. this is the ONLY pace that this bot maybe produced at ANY TIME. 

This is my project based on Victor Tran's "AstralMod" Version 2.0. This is the 1st discord bot that i have ever worked on. there is almost 
no way shape OR form that this will tell you EXACTLY how to ser it up and test it. if you want to see the code be my guest. i am cerrently 
in need of some help doing the fallowing commands that you will see below this description. i am cerrently in highschool and still do not know 
what the hell im doing. this project might get forgotton for a wile but at the moment it is in development. i am in the prosess of converting
the code from Astralmod to Light House and another bot that i am cerrently woring on. this file will be revised SEVERAL TIMES! wile
this bot is in development. i you want to contribute to the bot let me know. 


things that i am trying to code: 
Weather command
Memes command
Cat pic
More as it develops
